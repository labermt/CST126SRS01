Unresolved Issues: Everything.  

Notes: This assignment was a lot harder than I thought it would be. First thing I ran into was running the program that was given to us.
I didn't even change anything, I just wanted to run it to see what it spewed out. It immediately gave me an error in the command prompt, 
and then I saw I had a list of 33 errors. From there, I tried to figure out what went wrong. I'm thinking it was most likely the way that 
I saved it or something during that process that threw it off but I couldn't get past those errors to even begin the assignment. It 
frustrates me because I know what was needed in this assignment and I was ready to attack it and now I'm turning in something that is 
worthless because of the issues I ran into and not being able to fix it or continue with the assignment. This is all while still getting
used to GitHub and learning how to use that too so this assignment was extra frustrating.
